# Quick Sanity Setup Guide

## ✅ What We've Done So Far
- Created Sanity project (ID: l8zvozfy)
- Connected your website to Sanity
- Your website is ready to receive content

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Step 1: Access Your Studio
Go to: **https://l8zvozfy.sanity.studio/**

### Step 2: Set Up Content Types
You need to add the content schemas. Here are your options:

#### Option A: Use Sanity's Schema Builder (Recommended)
1. In your Sanity dashboard, look for "Schema" or "Content Model"
2. Create these content types manually:
   - **Service** (for your services)
   - **Home Page** (for home page content)
   - **About Page** (for about page content)
   - **Services Page** (for services page content)

#### Option B: Import Schema Configuration
If you're comfortable with code, you can use the schema file I created (`sanity-schemas.js`)

### Step 3: Add Your First Content
Once schemas are set up:
1. Create some services
2. Create your home page content
3. Create your about page content

### Step 4: Test the Connection
Visit http://localhost:3000 and see your content appear!
