# Simple Content Setup Guide

## 🎯 Goal
Get your website showing real content instead of placeholder text.

## 📋 What We Need to Create

### 1. Services (Individual service items)
Create these fields:
- **Title** (text) - e.g., "Web Design"
- **Description** (text area) - e.g., "Professional web design services"
- **Slug** (slug) - auto-generated from title

### 2. Home Page Content
Create these fields:
- **Hero Title** (text) - e.g., "Welcome to Our Business"
- **Hero Subtitle** (text area) - e.g., "We provide excellent services"
- **Services Title** (text) - e.g., "Our Services"
- **Services Description** (text area) - e.g., "What we offer"

### 3. About Page Content
Create these fields:
- **Hero Title** (text) - e.g., "About Our Company"
- **Hero Subtitle** (text area) - e.g., "Learn more about us"
- **Content** (rich text) - Your about page content

## 🚀 Quick Test Method

**Option 1: Manual Content Entry**
If Sanity's web interface allows you to create content types manually, create the above fields and add some content.

**Option 2: Use Existing Templates**
If your Sanity project has blog or other templates, we can modify them to work with your website.

## 🔍 What to Look For

In your Sanity dashboard, look for:
- ✅ "Create new document type" or "Add schema"
- ✅ "Content" or "Documents" section
- ✅ Any existing content types you can modify

## 📞 Next Steps

**Tell me what you see in your Sanity dashboard at [sanity.io/manage](https://sanity.io/manage)**

I'll help you either:
1. Set up content types manually
2. Use existing templates
3. Try a different approach

The goal is to get some content in there so your website stops showing "No content found" and starts showing your real content!
